# DEV-SCHOOl

Hi there :wave:. \
This is my first repo :smile_cat:.\
It was created simply for storing hometasks' solutions, but I believe it will end up being my first Pet Project or something. :wink:
## About me:
- My name is **Bohdan**. :sunglasses:
- I am a first-year student of the **Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**. :nerd_face:
- Currently learning **Backend** developing. :computer:
## Code:
To run code, first get it on your device. Then you can either open it via **IDE** and run it there or run it using a **terminal**.
- To run code you can use [**JetBrains WebStorm IDE**](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
- To run code via terminal you need [**Node.js**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/) installed on your device. Open a terminal in folder that contains file with code and then run in console this command: `Node.js [name].js`, where `[name]` is name of the file.
